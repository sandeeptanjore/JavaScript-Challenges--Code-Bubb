# JavaScript-Challenges--Code-Bubb
A code repo for JavaScript challenges by James Bubb. I created this repository that contains all source code against the challenges present in Ultimate Collection of JavaScript Exercises book published by JavaScript YouTuber James Bubb (https://www.juniordevelopercentral.com/)

The entire coding challenges are divided in the following order:
a) Language Basics ==> from exercise 1 to exercise 116
b) Intermediate Exercises ==> from exercise 117 to 202
c) Advanced Exercises ==> from exercise 203 to 240
d) Array Method Exercises ==> from exercise 241 to 301
e) DOM Exercises ==> from exercise 301 to 316
f) Scenario Based Exercises ==> from exercise 317 to 329
